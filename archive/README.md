# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used but kept for historical reference.

## Contents

- **Old documentation files** - Moved from project root
- **Deprecated configurations** - Legacy config files  
- **Analysis reports** - Structure and sync analysis files
- **Backup files** - Temporary backups of modified files

## Guidelines

- Files in this directory are not included in the main build process
- They are preserved for reference and potential future use
- Regular cleanup may be performed to remove very old files
- If you need to restore a file, copy it back to the appropriate location
