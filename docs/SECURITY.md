## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Otogram team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Otogram, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@otogram.project** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. **Acknowledge** receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Confirm** the problem and determine the affected versions within 5 business days  
3. **Audit** code to find any potential similar problems
4. **Prepare** fixes for all supported releases
5. **Release** new versions and publish security advisories
